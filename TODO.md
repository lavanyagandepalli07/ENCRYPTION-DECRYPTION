## Key Metrics & Goals

- **Security:** AES-256-GCM encryption with PBKDF2-SHA256 key derivation
- **Performance:** Support 500MB-5GB files with streaming (no memory exhaustion)
- **Reliability:** 100% audit logging of all operations
- **Usability:** < 3 clicks to encrypt/decrypt a file
- **Deployment:** Docker containerization with production-ready configs
- **Testing:** ≥80% code coverage on crypto and service layers

---

## Known Limitations & Workarounds

1. **File ID Generation:** Currently files are stored in Supabase; need ID generation strategy for decryption reference
2. **Session Management:** Supabase JWT tokens have 1-hour expiry; need refresh token handling
3. **Browser Download:** Large files (>2GB) may have browser limitations; verify browser caps
4. **Memory Usage:** Monitor JVM heap size for large file encryption operations
5. **Rate Limiting:** Implement per-IP or per-user rate limiting to prevent abuse

---

## Security Considerations

✓ **In Place:**
- AES-256-GCM encryption (authenticated encryption)
- PBKDF2-SHA256 key derivation (100k iterations)
- Random IV per encryption operation
- JWT authentication via Supabase
- Row-Level Security (RLS) on audit logs
- HTTPS-only communication (production)

⚠️ **To Implement:**
- Rate limiting on encrypt/decrypt endpoints
- CORS policy enforcement
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- HSTS headers for HTTPS
- Input validation and sanitization
- File upload size limits
- Passphrase complexity requirements
- Secure session timeout
